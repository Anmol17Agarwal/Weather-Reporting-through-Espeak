# Weather-Reporting-through-Espeak

## What is Weather Cloud?
Openweather NWP (numerical weather prediction) allows to calculate weather data for any location. We use proprietary convolutional neural network that collects and processes wide range of data sources to cover any location and consider the local nuances of climate. 

ML technology allows us to reach resolution about 500 m and very high accuracy between 90% and 100% with inaccuracy about 1%. Amongst data sources we feed to the NWP are 82,000 weather stations spread globally; national meteorological agencies (NOAA, Environment Canada, Met Office, etc.), radars, weather satellites.

- ### How to start and continue calling Openweather API in the best way
Openweather API is one of the most recognisable and elegant APIs. Powered by ML technologies, it provides all necessary for businesses weather information for any location on the globe. All you need to start using it is to sign up and call API straightforwardly.

- ### API key is all you need to call weather API
Please, use your API key in each API call. We do not process API requests without any API key. We count requests from all API keys that associate with your account.

## What is espeak?
eSpeakNG is a compact, open-source, software speech synthesizer for Linux, Windows, and other platforms. It uses a formant synthesis method, providing many languages in a small size. Much of the programming for eSpeakNG's language support is done using rule files with feedback from native speakers.
